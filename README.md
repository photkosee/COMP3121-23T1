# Algorithms and Programming Techniques COMP3121 2023 Term 1

## Course Information

COMP3121 Algorithms and Programming Techniques (aka COMP9101 Design and Analysis of Algorithms, for postgraduate students) runs in all three terms each year. The extended version (COMP3821/9801) runs only in T1 each year. We recommend that top students take the extended course instead of this one.

## Learning Outcomes

Be able to design new algorithms for solving new problems, using various design techniques (greedy, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, etc)
Be able to estimate efficiency of algorithms and justify their correctness
Be able to demonstrate improved problem solving skills
